  <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. The first version of Minecraft was released in May 2009 after developing the game for ten months. It has since gone through many updates, including several updates that added new features and gameplay elements.</p>

    <p class="funfact">Fun Fact:<br><br>Creepers were created by accident when Notch messed up the pig design.</p>
    <p class="text2">As Minecraft became more popular, Notch formed a company called Mojang to help develop the game. Mojang added more features, such as new blocks, creatures, and worlds for players to explore. In 2011, Mojang released the official full version of Minecraft. This launch brought even more attention to the game and led to a huge increase in its player base.</p>
    <p class="text3">In 2014, Microsoft bought Mojang and took over Minecraft. With more support, the game continued to grow and received regular updates. It also spread to many platforms, making it one of the most popular games in the world.</p>
